Hello, I am Jaeyoung Kang, undergraduate student at the Korea University, majoring Electrical Enginnering.

Currently, I work in LICS at Korea University, supervised by Prof. Sang Hyun Lee.

When I away from research, I mostly spend time with my family and do some personal toy project. Sometimes I go out for jogging (training for a marathon) and try to taste various kinds of beer.
