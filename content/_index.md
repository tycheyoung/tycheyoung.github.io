Hello, I am Jaeyoung Kang, undergraduate student at the Korea University, majoring Electrical Enginnering.

When I away from research, I mostly spend time with my family, and do some personal project. Sometimes I go out for a jogging(training for a marathon), and try to taste various kinds of beer.
